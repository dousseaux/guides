# AWS Summit São Paulo 2018

### Building Data Lakes and Analytics on AWS

Over 90% of today’s data was generated in the last two years, and the rate of data growth isn’t slowing. In this session, we step through the challenges and best practices for capturing all the data that’s being generated, understanding what data you have, driving insights, and predicting the future using AWS services. We frame the session and demonstrations around common pitfalls of building data lakes and how to successfully drive analytics and insights from data. We also discuss the architecture patterns, bringing together key AWS services and rather than doing a deep dive on any single service. We show how services such as Amazon S3, AWS Glue, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon Machine Learning services are put together to build a successful data lake for various roles, including data scientists and business users.

### Serverless Data Processing at Scale: An Amazon.com Case Study

Come to this session and learn how Amazon takes advantage of AWS Lambda with Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to run a highly scalable, high-throughput pipeline to support its data processing needs. We cover different example architectures that handle such use cases as in-line process and data manipulation. We also discuss the advantages of using the AWS platform to manage different streams for data processing.

### Serverless in Practice: From Architecture to Implementation

Serverless has been one of the fastest growing technologies in past year, but do you know what the limitations are; how it helps you; and what to consider before building a serverless architecture? In this session, we answer these questions and any others you might have. We also do an interactive demonstration.

### Using Machine Learning and Big Data in the Cloud

In this session, learn how to use the cloud for applications that previously seemed almost impossible to develop due to their cost. Learn how to create a camera image recognition app from your mobile phone in a few steps using machine learning, big data, and the AWS Cloud. Never again make the gaffe of forgetting or simply not knowing a person's name in a meeting. We will use the tools of the moment: Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Rekognition, and AWS Lambda. Let's see cloud computing work the way it should.
